# Collaborating with Alfresco

We realize that finding the right place to raise an issue can be challenging, so this repository serves as a "catch-all" place. We regularly triage issues raised here and route them to the appropriate repository for further investigation.

## No support requests

The issue trackers on Github are not the right place for support requests. For enterprise customers, please raise support tickets via the [Alfresco Support Portal](https://myalfresco.force.com/support/SiteLogin). You can also post a question on the [Alfresco Hub](http://hub.alfresco.com/).
